**Fluxo** is a simple yet super powerful MVI / MVVM+ library for Kotlin Multiplatform.

**Work-In-Progress**, first release is coming. **API is not stable yet!**

### TLDR: Use SNAPSHOT Artefact in Gradle

```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation("io.github.fluxo-kt:fluxo-core:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT")
  // For common data states
  implementation("io.github.fluxo-kt:fluxo-data:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT")
}
repositories {
  maven(url = "https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/")
}
```

## Overview

**Fluxo** was started as a test for the hypothesis:
_it should be possible to combine all the strong sides of strict **Redux/MVI** with flexibility,
ease of readability, and maintainability of the **MVVM+**._

The experiment paid off!
It is possible to combine **MVVM+** with high-quality time-travel, logging,
auto-analysis of the transition graph and much more.
A long list of features is implemented gradually in this library (see the [Roadmap](#roadmap) for details).

Basic usage is elementary, yet you can take advantage of fine-tuning and super powerful features when you need them.

* Kotlin **coroutine-based** state handling.
* One-liner creation, simple usage, type-safe, no-boilerplate.
* **Multiplatform**, supports all Kotlin MPP/KMM targets (**Android**, **iOS**, **JVM**,
  **JS**, **Linux**, **Windows/MinGW**, **macOS**, **watchOS**, **tvOS**).
* Different usage styles:
  * Strict **Redux/MVI** (the highest correctness guarantees, but may be subjectively less readable and intuitive)
  * Simple and flexible **MVVM+**
    (see [contextual reduction](https://dev.to/feresr/a-case-against-the-mvi-architecture-pattern-1add),
    [orbit-way](https://github.com/orbit-mvi/orbit-mvi#what-is-orbit), intuitively readable, may be easier
    to maintain, support every feature and more :)
  * Redux-style discrete Inputs with MVVM+ style reduction DSL (hybrid way)
  * _More is coming…_
* **Side effects** support (sometimes called news or events).
  * Four strategies allow you to fully control how side effects sharing can be handled in the Store
    (_RECEIVE_, _CONSUME_, _SHARE_, _DISABLE_).
  * Side effects are cached while the subscriber (e.g., view) is not attached.
  * Side effects consumption guarantees with `GuaranteedEffect` (effect handled and exactly
    once) [[1](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/issues/2886),
    [2](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/livedata-with-snackbar-navigation-and-other-events-the-singleliveevent-case-ac2622673150)].
* **Lifecycle-awareness** with full control based on coroutine scopes.
* Subscription lifecycle with convenience API (`repeatOnSubscription`).
* Forceful customization:
  * Pluggable **input strategies**:
    * _First In, First Out_ (Fifo). Default, predictable and intuitive, good performance.
    * _Last In, First Out_ (Lifo). Can improve responsiveness for e.g., UI events processing, but can lose some intents!
    * _Parallel_. No processing order guarantees, can provide better performance comparing to _Fifo_.
    * Create your own!
  * Bootstrap (initialization tasks), eager or lazy initialization.
  * Errors handling and on exception behavior control.
  * Global default settings for easier setup of state stores swarm.
    * Change settings once and for all at one place (`FluxoSettings.DEFAULT`).
    * Provide prepared settings object for the group of your stores.
    * Just configure each store individually.
* Common data states in a [`fluxo-data`](fluxo-data) module *(Success, Failure, Loading, Cached, Empty, Not Loaded)*.
* Side jobs for long-running tasks (MVVM+ DSL).
* Leak-free transfer, delivery
  guarantees [[1](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/issues/1936), [2](https://gmk57.medium.com/unfortunately-events-may-be-dropped-if-channel-receiveasflow-cfe78ae29004)].
* Strictly not recommended, but JVM `Closeable` resources partially supported as a state and side effects.
  * The previous state will be closed on change.
  * Side effects closed when not delivered.
  * However, no clear guarantees!
* Intentionally unopinionated, extensible API: you can follow guides or use it as you want.
* Well tested.
* Reactive streams compatibility
  through [coroutine wrappers](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/tree/master/reactive):
  * RxJava 2.x, RxJava 3.x
  * Flow (JDK 9), Reactive Streams
  * Project Reactor
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines#livedata) compatibility with
  AndroidX.

### Based on architectural ideas:

* [MVI: Model-View-Intent](http://hannesdorfmann.com/android/model-view-intent/)
* [MVVM: Model-View-ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)
* [FSM: Finite-state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine)
* [SAM: State-Action-Model](https://sam.js.org/)

### Inspired and based on ideas from:

* [Ballast](https://github.com/copper-leaf/ballast)
* [Orbit MVI](https://github.com/orbit-mvi/orbit-mvi)
* [MVIKotlin](https://github.com/arkivanov/MVIKotlin)
