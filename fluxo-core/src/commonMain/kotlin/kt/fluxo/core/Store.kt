/**
 * The core of the Fluxo MVI.
 * Represents a state node with its inputs (intents) and outputs (state updates).
 *
 * [Store] implements [StateFlow] and [FlowCollector] interfaces,
 * allowing to combine different [Store]s with each other and with other [Flow]s.
 * Also [Store] is a [CoroutineScope], so you can integrate it with any existing coroutine workflow.
 * Finally, [Store] is a [Closeable] as it can help to consume it in JVM environment.
 *
 * Tip: use [isActive][kotlinx.coroutines.isActive] to get if store is active (not closed).
 *
 * @param Intent Intent type for this [Store]. See [Container] for MVVM+ [Store].
 * @param State State type for this [Store].
 *
 * @see StoreSE for the state store with side effects
 * @see Container for the state store with side effects
